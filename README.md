Welcome to Megazoo Inc. - one of the world's leading zoo owners, animal rehabilitation experts, and proud record holder of the “Biggest Zoo on the Planet” award.


As you might imagine, when working with zoos that have up to 15 000 enclosures (yes, that’s right), it can be quite tricky to feed all the animals with a limited number of zookeepers.

Your IT department was carefully selected to create a program that feeds the animals with a pre-programmed drone.

Fully automated, efficient, and convenient. This would allow the zookeepers to focus on more important tasks within the zoo.
